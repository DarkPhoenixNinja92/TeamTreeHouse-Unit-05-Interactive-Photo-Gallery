This project was originally built as part of my time working on the TeamTreeHouse Front End TechDegree. As a result, it is exclusively a front end project.
There is no interaction with a server or back end, nor is there any sort of ability to upload additional photos. This project enables the user to search and filter existing photos and view them in a fullscreen,
lightbox style view but that is the limit of the interactivity.

If you would like to see a completed, live preview version of this project then a live version of this project can be found [here](https://ShaunPour.github.io/TeamTreeHouse-Unit-05-Interactive-Photo-Gallery)
